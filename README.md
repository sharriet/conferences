# Conferences
A list of conferences that may be of interest to tech folk based in the UK, especially those looking for speaker/workshopping opportunities.

I've tended to exclude conferences that involve a lot of air miles, except in cases where there isn't a comparable UK equivalent.

Please submit a pull request to help keep this list up to date and useful (that includes suggesting the deletion of any rubbish ones!)
